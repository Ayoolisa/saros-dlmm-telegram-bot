4. Usage in TelegramFind Your Bot: Search for your bot's name in Telegram.Start: Send the /start command.Wallet Setup: The bot will prompt you to either Create a new wallet (recommended for testing) or Import a wallet. Note: Wallet data is stored temporarily in memory and is for Devnet testing only.Fund: Use the /faucet command to get test SOL for transaction fees.Interact: Use the inline buttons or the /add_liquidity command to begin managing your DLMM positions!5. Technical Note & DisclaimerThis application uses a mock DLMM service for execution and confirmation logic, allowing testing of the full command flow without requiring complex external contract imports. It is designed for Devnet testing purposes only.The bot stores user wallets in an in-memory map (session store). This data is volatile and will be lost if the bot is restarted. This method was chosen to comply with the hackathon's submission environment constraints but is NOT suitable for production use.
